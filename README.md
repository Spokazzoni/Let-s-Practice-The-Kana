Hello, welcome to "Lets Practice Kana". This is a small minigame created for the sole purpose of helping people who want to learn Japanese memorise the kana characters (Hiragana and Katakana).

How to play:
   1. Launch the executable file. You will be asked how many characters you wish to practice. Enter the desired amount. 
   2. Select the kana you want to practice (Katakana, Hiragana, or both).
   3. The game will show you a random list of the romanised kana. Write the Japanese version in a notebook and press enter.
   4. You will be shown the correct results. You may compare them with yours.

Important Notes:
   1. There are only 68 characters in the game.
   1.1. This includes the base kana and the one with a diacritical mark.
   1.2. 3 Kana have the same romanised sound with some others, thus 2 correct results will be shown for them.
   2. The game is still in early alpha and is currently privated. It will be released soon.
   3. The game will be very minimalistic during beta releases. All suggestions are welcome!
