Welcome to "Lets Practice The Kana", by Spokazzoni.

This was made as a project to help myself become better at the Japanese Alphabet. I thought that it might be a good idea to share the project with other aspiring learners as well. I am pleased to announce that I have decided to do exactly that. This is a minigame that randomly picks some Romaji. It will wait for confirmation and then will display the results in kana (more on that later). It is a good way to practice writing or memorising the Japanese kana.

The game features:
   - 69 Romaji characters, 71 Hiragana characters and 71 Katakana characters
     (I merged duplicate Romaji characters, so when a character shows that has 2 ways to write it just write both. I.e. ji = じ/ぢ)

   - An active game loop that stops once the user requests (or when you close the window)
      - Failsafes in case the user gives the wrong input
   - A console environment.
     (I am planning to upgrade it to an interactive GUI in the first "Beta" release)

How to install:
   Go to the Releases Tab, download the executable file of the desired version and open it

How to play:
   - Upon opening the game, you will be asked wether you want to practice Hiragana, Katakana or both. Write the desired mode (not case sensitive).
   - Input the desired amount of characters you want displayed at a time (for 1 time)
   - Practice the characters displayed in the desired way (i.e. write on paper)
   - See the Japanese kana for the characters displayed
   - Answer "Yes" if you want to play again or "No" if you don't

Feedback, support and feature requests:
   All feedback, support and feature requests go to the issues page. I would love to hear your opinions, what you would want to be added and ways to make something different.

   For marking issues in regards to support ("Help" Label) or bug reports ("Bug" Label), please follow the following rules:
   -  Tell us the expected behaviour that you thought your input would produce
   -  Tell us the actual behaviour that got produced.
   -  Tell us the steps to reproduce the problem.
   -  (Optional) Include pictures of the problem so we can better understand what to look for.
   Example:
      Hello, I need help with no clipping when hitting the third light post of the road!
      
      Expected behaviour:
         Hit the third light post of the "Mizirolorld" road and knock it down.
      Actual behaviour:
         My character gets dropped below the world board, killing me.
      Steps to reproduce:
         Hit the third light post of the "Mizirolorld" road from the left side and keep walking forward.
         Your character will seem to fly off into the sky. Then you will be teleported below the game world.
